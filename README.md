# DWEasyFlipFlop
Arduino Library for calling 2 different function with desigred intervals.

What for?
You need call 2 functins periodicaly with different intervals without delaying your loop flow;
Let's say function1 (flip) will be trigered at the begining and 300 millisecondes function2 will fired for 10 millisecondes ... end so on.

How?
Library is very simple to use.
+You define delays
+Define callback functions (functions will be fired after millisecondes set)
+Put the flipflop loop (engine) in arduino loop function

That's all, continue programming in ease.
